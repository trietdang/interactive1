	<p>This project was inspired when I saw a friend of mine tried to unlock his window laptop by using the webcam feature to read his face instead of using type password. My question is what if someone tries to access to your laptop and steal your private informations by scanning your face while you are sleeping? To avoid the face reading function of computer, in this stage of my project, I put different facial elements of different people from different races, genders in an individual. Hope you enjoy it! </p>
