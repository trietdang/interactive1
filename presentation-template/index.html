	<p>The design of Mac OS informs much of how we think of mouse cursors today. Their limited resolution, effected their aesthetic representation.</p>

	<br />
	<p> "Poking is existed when Facebook first came out in 2004. What did it mean if someone poked you? Facebook wouldn’t tell you. All it would say was “Poke Him!”</p>
	<p>or “Poke Her!” or “You poked [your friend].” If you went to Facebook’s help pages, Facebook was coy: “When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool</p>
	<p>to have a feature without any specific purpose,” Facebook said. “People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings.”</p>
